So the first thing we had to do is to resize all the images to 32x32x3 and read them into a numpy array as training features. At the same time, we created another numpy array with labels of each image. We needed to do the same for testing images. However the labels for testing images are stored as ClassId in test.csv with paths of that image. So I use pandas to read the csv file, load the image from the path and assign the corresponding ClassId. Here is a comparison between an RGB and grayscale image. The grayscale image still retains its features and can be recognized but with much smaller size.  From the training set, I randomly spitted 20% as a validation set for use during the process of model training. The model accuracy of training and validation will give us information about underfitting or overfitting.
